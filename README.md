# Melanoma Detection using Convolutional Neural Network

## Problem Statement
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## File Information
- README.md - This is the readme file giving a brief about the project
- multiclass-classification-using-cnn-tensorflow.ipynb - This file contains the Python code, used for data reading, cleansing, analysis and graph generation and various steps coded for building the regularized CNN model for the assignment.
